# On Free Will

What can this understanding of [Schemas](/schematic-approach/foundation/Schemas) tell us about the feeling of free will? This feeling that with some of our actions, we appear to be making a choice, not that the choice is random or thrust upon us.

## Exploring Non-Free Will

There are two categories of actions that don't feel like free will: actions without choice and actions without will.

### Actions Without Choice

There are many situations where we feel like we have no choice but to act in a certain way:

- When you touch something hot, you pull your hand away before you even consciously process it. This doesn't feel like a choice - it's an automatic response hardwired into our nervous system.

- When someone you love is in danger, you may act to protect them without any sense of choice. The emotional drive is so strong that alternatives don't even enter consciousness.

- Sometimes social or moral imperatives feel so strong that we experience them as forces rather than choices. If you see someone drop their wallet, you might feel compelled to return it without experiencing this as a choice.

### Actions Without Will

Similarly, there are times when our actions feel more random than chosen:

- When choosing between identical options (like which identical sock to put on first), we often act without any real decision-making process.

- After making many decisions, we sometimes reach a point where we stop weighing options and just pick something arbitrarily.

These examples highlight situations where our experience differs from the feeling of free will - either because we feel compelled by forces beyond our control or because our actions seem to lack conscious direction altogether.

## The Decision Schema

Our brain works as a collection of schemas. These schemas can be described as a **trained abstract probabilistic simulator**.  We have this for understanding our body and it's movement, for understanding the world around us, and for understanding how others will react.  For each of these, the schema does not simulate everything to the lowest level of detail but instead makes large abstractions. It then uses probabilistic distributions to fill in the details. 

Like everything our brain does, we can expect that it uses a [schema](/schematic-approach/foundation/Schemas) when evaluating why we have acted the way we do. As this decision simulator is abstracted, we do not have perfect information on the action we will take, but instead only a probabilistic distribution.  When we reflect back on our actions, our schema can provide possible courses, even ones not taken, and how probable they were. 

## Shape of the Distributions

The shape of this heuristic distribution is what gives rise to our feeling of free will.  

### The Single Choice

In a distribution where one possibility of action dominates all others, we do not feel like we had a choice - there was only one reasonable action. Let's examine our earlier examples through this lens of probability distributions:

- **Hot surface reaction**: The probability distribution here has an overwhelming spike for "pull hand away" with negligible probabilities for all other actions. Our brain's decision schema recognizes this as a "no choice" situation.

- **Protecting loved ones**: Similar to above, the distribution shows an extreme peak for "protect" with minimal probability mass elsewhere. The emotional and instinctual drivers create such a dominant option that alternatives barely register.

- **Returning a wallet**: Here the distribution might show a very high peak for "return it" due to moral/social conditioning, with small probabilities for "keep it" or "ignore it". While not as extreme as the reflexive examples, it's still lopsided enough that we experience it as compulsion rather than choice.

### Too Many Equal Options

On the other extreme, if the distribution is flat with lots of options that have the same probability, we also do not feel free will - we instead feel a lack of will. Let's examine our earlier examples:

- **Identical socks**: The probability distribution here is perfectly flat across the options - each sock has exactly equal probability of being chosen. Our decision schema recognizes this uniform distribution as "random" rather than willed choice.

- **Decision fatigue**: When mentally exhausted, our probability distributions tend to flatten out across options. Rather than sharp peaks representing clear preferences, we see more uniform distributions that lead to experiences of random rather than willed choices.

### The Shape of Free Will

But what if the distribution is neither flat nor spiked? What if there are multiple options that are reasonable but with varying degrees of probability? This is the shape of free will.

## The Power of Introspection

One power we have is the ability to introspect - to consciously examine our decisions and thought processes. When we direct our attention to a decision, we often change the amount of information feeding into our decision schema. Interestingly, this examination can significantly alter the shape of our probability distribution.

For example:
- Through introspection, we might realize we always put on the left sock first simply because we're right-handed and naturally reach to the left. This insight transforms what seemed like a random choice into a pattern driven by physical constraints.

- When we deeply examine the moral choice of returning a found wallet, we might consider alternative uses for the money or rationalize keeping a "finder's fee". This introspection can transform what initially felt like a clear moral imperative into a more complex decision with multiple weighted options - shifting from a spike-shaped distribution to one more characteristic of free will.

## Conclusion

The experience of free will appears to emerge from the interplay between our decision-making schemas and the probability distributions they generate. When we feel we have free will, it's often because we're encountering a decision space with multiple viable options that have different but comparable probabilities. This creates a sweet spot between complete randomness and pure determinism.

This model helps explain why the debate over free will has persisted for so long - our experience of it is neither purely deterministic nor purely random, but rather emerges from complex probability distributions that can shift based on context, attention, and introspection.
