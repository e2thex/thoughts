# Schemas

A **schema** is best defined as a **trained abstract probabilistic simulator**.

It is a **simulator**, in that it can generate multiple possible paths or outcomes, not just a single prediction, but a dynamic engine capable of exploring different scenarios. It is **abstract** in that it strips away unnecessary details, constructing representations of the essential features needed for its purpose. It is **probabilistic** in that it uses heuristics to fill in the gaps, estimating likelihoods rather than certainties. And it is **trained** through experience and feedback, becoming more efficient at generating useful simulations over time.

Schemas dramatically reduce the brain's computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need to process all sensory inputs in detail. Instead of evaluating every piece of information, schemas allow the brain to quickly react based on simplified patterns and minimal inputs. They act as efficient mental shortcuts, letting us respond rapidly without having to analyze the full complexity of a situation.

## Examples of Schemas

Several schemas are widely hypothesized in neuroscience and cognitive science. Each reflects this definition. They are trained, abstract, probabilistic simulators built through development and refined by experience.

### Body Schema

The **body schema** is a simulation of the body's shape, position, and capabilities. It allows us to move through the world without constantly needing to monitor our limbs visually.

- **Trained** through infancy and constantly refined through movement and sensory feedback  
- **Abstract** across different body positions, lighting conditions, or tool use  
- **Probabilistic** in its prediction of where the body should be

### Attention Schema

The **attention schema** is a model of how attention is allocated, both one's own and others'. This schema allows us to anticipate what will be noticed or focused on.

- **Trained** through social and perceptual experience  
- **Abstract** across sensory modalities  
- **Probabilistic** in determining what is likely to be noticed

### Theory of Mind Schema

This schema simulates the mental states of others, including what they know, believe, want, or intend.

- **Trained** through interaction and communication  
- **Abstract** across individuals and situations  
- **Probabilistic** in its inferences about other minds

## Schema Development Through Training

While a schema is fixed, new schemas are created based on the previous but trained and refined through exposure, feedback, and repetition. In training, we do not simply memorize actions. We reshape the underlying simulator.

Athletes are a clear example of this refinement:

- A gymnast or dancer develops a highly accurate **body schema** that allows for precise timing and balance  
- A quarterback or soccer player strengthens a **theory-of-mind schema** for predicting opponents' behaviors  
- In highly trained actions, **abstraction may actually decrease**. Movements become automatic and low-level simulation takes over for speed and efficiency

Training can **sharpen the predictive accuracy** of a schema and also **specialize it** for a narrow set of conditions. Both of these outcomes serve the same purpose: to make the brain's simulations faster, more accurate, and better matched to the task at hand.

These individual schemas are deeply interconnected facets of a single, comprehensive simulator: the [Reality Schema](Reality-schema.md). Schemas create representations that we call [Constructs](Constructs.md), which are patterns of coherence within a reality.
