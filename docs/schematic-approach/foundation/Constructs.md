# Constructs

Part of the pattern of [Schemas](/schematic-approach/foundation/Schemas) is that they create representations of $R_0$ (reality nought) through the [reality schema](/schematic-approach/foundation/Reality-schema). These we call **Constructs**.

A **Construct** is not a definition but a pattern of coherence within a reality. It is a probabilistic structure that allows experiences or perceptions to be matched, compared, and organized. A construct is not a fixed category ("what red is") but a dynamic field of resemblance ("what is red-like"). In this sense, constructs are operational patterns, not propositional truths; they are the ways a reality holds its world together through degrees of similarity.

## An Example: Red

To see how a construct works, consider the experience of color, specifically, the construct _red_. If I show a group of people this box:
<div style="background-color:#E75480 ; color:#E75480; border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px auto;width:100px; border-radius: 5px;"> This is a pink box. </div>
If I ask, "Is this red?" the group will likely be divided. If I ask instead, "Is this red or green?" nearly everyone will choose red. And if I ask, "Is this red or pink?" most will choose pink.  
The boundaries of the answer shift depending on the comparison.

What this reveals is that red does not have a definition but instead a probabilistic region of coherence. Each reality has learned, through its own training and syncing, what falls inside the "red-like" pattern. Recognition happens when an experience fits closely enough to that pattern, not when it satisfies a rule.

A construct, then, is not a statement about the world but a way of organizing it. It is how a reality compresses the continuous field of experience into usable units. When we say something is red, what we really mean is that it sits near the center of a pattern that our reality has found stable and meaningful.

## An Example: Sad

Sad is another construct; it abstracts the complexity of our bodies. This pattern is also something we can match against other people/animals.

Constructs are central to [Epistemology](/schematic-approach/Epistemology) in the Schematic Approach, as they represent the stable features of knowing. They also have interesting mathematical properties, as explored in [Construct Math](/schematic-approach/Epistemology#construct-math).
