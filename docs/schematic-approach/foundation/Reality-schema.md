# The Reality Schema

While we describe these schemas—body, attention, theory of mind, and others—as distinct entities, the boundaries between them are far from clear. When shaking someone's hand, for instance, it's impossible to cleanly separate where your body schema ends and your theory of mind schema begins. These categories are useful tools for analyzing brain function, but in reality, they are deeply interconnected facets of a single, comprehensive simulator: the **reality schema**.

The reality schema is the brain's amalgamated simulation engine, where all these seemingly separate [Schemas](Schemas.md) blend and flow into one another. It is a continuously updated probabilistic model that is not just a combination of these different aspects of experience, but an integration of them.

The reality schema is **not the world itself**. It is the internal simulation that **feels** like the world. It is how we navigate, interpret, and interact with our surroundings. It is our **personal reality**. 

So while there may exist a reality that is not our perception, a $R_0$ (reality nought), if you will, all of us have our own reality, which we will call $R_p$ (personal reality).

The reality schema creates representations of $R_0$ through [Constructs](Constructs.md), which are patterns of coherence that allow experiences to be matched, compared, and organized.

This concept is central to understanding [Consciousness](Consciousness.md), as consciousness and the reality schema are one and the same.
