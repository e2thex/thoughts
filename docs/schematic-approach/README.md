# The Schematic Approach

An exploration of consciousness, cognition, and reality through the lens of schemas—trained abstract probabilistic simulators.

## Overview

A **schema** is best defined as a **trained abstract probabilistic simulator**. These mental structures allow the brain to navigate the world efficiently by creating simplified, probabilistic models rather than processing every detail. The Schematic Approach uses this framework to understand consciousness, epistemology, free will, ethics, and more.

The central insight is that what we call **consciousness** is actually our **reality schema**—the brain's amalgamated simulation engine that creates our personal reality ($R_p$) from the raw data of objective reality ($R_0$).

## Navigation

### Foundation

These core concepts form the basis of the Schematic Approach:

- **[Schemas](Schemas.md)** - The fundamental definition and examples of schemas (Body Schema, Attention Schema, Theory of Mind Schema)
- **[Reality Schema](Reality-schema.md)** - The unified simulator that integrates all schemas into our personal reality
- **[Constructs](Constructs.md)** - Patterns of coherence that schemas create to organize experience

### Applications

The Schematic Approach applied to major philosophical and cognitive questions:

- **[Consciousness](Consciousness.md)** - How consciousness emerges from the reality schema, with examples from twins, teams, and personal experience
- **[Epistemology](Epistemology.md)** - What it means to know, truth as a construct, and the mathematics of constructs
- **[Free Will](free-will.md)** - How the feeling of free will emerges from probability distributions in the decision schema
- **[Ethics](Ethics.md)** - Exploring ethics through the schema framework (in progress)

## Suggested Reading Order

1. **Start with Foundation**: Read [Schemas](Schemas.md), [Reality Schema](Reality-schema.md), and [Constructs](Constructs.md) to understand the core framework.

2. **Explore Applications**: From there, the applications can be read in any order, though they build on each other:
   - [Consciousness](Consciousness.md) shows how the reality schema is consciousness itself
   - [Epistemology](Epistemology.md) explores what we can know through constructs
   - [Free Will](free-will.md) examines decision-making through schemas
   - [Ethics](Ethics.md) applies the framework to moral reasoning (in progress)

3. **Cross-Reference Freely**: Documents contain inline links to related concepts. Follow these connections as your interest guides you.

## Key Concepts

- **$R_0$** (Reality Nought): The objective reality that exists independently of perception. Not abstract, all-seeing, all-knowing.
- **$R_p$** (Personal Reality): Each individual's reality schema—their personal simulation of the world.
- **Schema**: A trained abstract probabilistic simulator used by the brain.
- **Construct**: A pattern of coherence within a reality, not a fixed definition but a dynamic field of resemblance.

## Note on Cross-References
