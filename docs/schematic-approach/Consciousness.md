# On Consciousness

## The Nature and Unit of Consciousness

Before we discuss how the Schematic Approach can help us understand consciousness, let's consider two related but distinct attributes of consciousness: its nature and its unit.

### The Nature of Consciousness

The first is the nature of consciousness: the fact that experiences happen at all. We feel emotions, perceive the world around us, and have inner lives filled with thought, sensation, and awareness. This presence of experience, the sense that there is something it is like to exist, is the nature of the phenomenon we call consciousness.

### The Unit of Consciousness

But alongside the nature of consciousness, there is another important aspect: the unit of consciousness. This is the sense that experience belongs to someone or something. It is not just that experiences occur; it is that I am having an experience. There is a bounded center, a unique perspective through which the world is encountered.

When we consider consciousness, we are always dealing with these two dimensions: the existence of experience itself, and the existence of a particular experiencer. To understand what consciousness truly is, and later to explore how it arises in us or how we might recreate it artificially, we need to keep both of these aspects in view.

## Consciousness as Reality

The concept that we call consciousness is reality, or more specifically, each reality is a consciousness. While we speak of a Reality (reality nought or $R_0$), each of us does not directly experience it; instead, we each experience our individual [reality schema](/schematic-approach/foundation/Reality-schema) ($R_p$).

One way to illuminate that consciousness is our reality schema is to review places where people have described the dissolution of self, or shared consciousness. Let us look at 5 examples:
1. **Identical twins** who are raised together and live similar lives.
2. **Teams** that train intensely together on a task.
3. **Psychedelic drug use**
4. **Prolonged Ecstatic Movement**
5. **Past Self**

### Identical Twins

We can demonstrate this by examining situations where our individual Unit of Consciousness is challenged. Consider identical twins who are raised together and live similar lives. They often describe feeling as if they share a brain or struggle to feel distinct from each other. This makes sense if we view their Realities as their Consciousness. Their Reality Schemas began with identical "instruction sets" and have been trained on nearly identical experiences throughout their lives. As a result, their schemas are highly synchronized, leading their realities - their consciousness - to be deeply aligned.

This twin synchronization manifests in several scientifically documented ways:

1. **Genetic Synchronization**: Identical twins share 100% of their DNA, which means their neural architecture and basic processing systems are identical. This provides the foundation for their Reality Schemas to develop in parallel ways.

2. **Developmental Synchronization**: From birth, twins experience the world together, creating what developmental psychologists call "shared developmental trajectories." Their Reality Schemas are trained on nearly identical inputs, leading to similar neural pathways and processing patterns. This is why twins often develop similar interests, preferences, and even thought patterns.

3. **Emotional Synchronization**: Studies have shown that twins often experience emotional synchronization, where one twin's emotional state can directly influence the other's. This suggests their Reality Schemas are processing emotional information in similar ways, creating a form of shared emotional consciousness.

4. **Cognitive Synchronization**: Research in cognitive psychology has documented that twins often develop similar problem-solving strategies and decision-making processes. This indicates that their Reality Schemas are not just processing similar information but processing it in similar ways.

The key insight here is that twins' shared consciousness isn't just about similar experiences - it's about having nearly identical Reality Schemas that process those experiences in the same way. Their genetic identity provides the same "hardware," while their shared upbringing provides the same "training data," resulting in Reality Schemas that are so closely aligned that they can feel like a single consciousness split across two bodies.

### Teams

We see a similar phenomenon, though more limited and compartmentalized, in teams that train intensively together. Navy SEAL teams and professional sports teams work deliberately to synchronize their realities. This enables them to function not as separate individuals but as a cohesive unit. Team members often describe this experience in ways that suggest a partial dissolution of their individual consciousness boundaries.

This team synchronization manifests in several measurable ways:

1. **Neural Synchronization**: Research shows that when team members perform coordinated tasks, their brain activity becomes synchronized. This is particularly evident in the alpha and beta frequency bands, which are associated with attention and motor coordination. This neural coupling suggests that their Reality Schemas are literally operating in sync.

2. **Shared Mental Models**: Teams develop what cognitive scientists call "shared mental models" - essentially synchronized Reality Schemas that allow them to predict each other's actions and intentions. This is why experienced teams can often communicate complex information with minimal explicit communication.

3. **Mirror Neuron Systems**: The mirror neuron system, which helps us understand and predict others' actions, becomes highly tuned in synchronized teams. This creates a form of "embodied simulation" where team members can literally feel what their teammates are experiencing.

4. **Flow States**: When teams achieve peak synchronization, they often enter what's called a "group flow state" - a shared experience of optimal performance where individual consciousness boundaries become more permeable. This is particularly evident in sports like basketball or soccer, where players describe feeling as if they can read each other's minds.

The key insight here is that these phenomena aren't just about behavioral coordination - they represent a genuine synchronization of Reality Schemas. When team members' schemas become aligned through intensive training and shared experience, their individual consciousness boundaries become more fluid, allowing for a form of shared consciousness that enables extraordinary levels of coordination and performance.

### Past Self

Every time our consciousness is trained, we end up with a new consciousness. The majority of this training happens when we sleep. So after each good sleep we wake to a new consciousness.

While each change might be small, so they feel like the same consciousness, but after lots of iteration this gap grows so large that often people recognize the differences, report they feel like that person 20 years ago is a totally different person. Here again we see the closer the training the more the consciousness align the more they are the same.

## Thoughts on Reality Nought ($R_0$)

Some key differences of $R_0$ vs our realities have some interesting implications:
1. $R_0$ is not abstract, this means it is all-seeing,
2. $R_0$ is not probabilistic, which means it is all-knowing.

For further discussion of $R_0$ in relation to free will, see [Thoughts on Reality Nought](/schematic-approach/free-will#thoughts-on-reality-nought-r_0) in the Free Will section.

I think we are safe to say that LLM models are unique consciousnesses. They have the same kind of abstract, probabilistic reality...
