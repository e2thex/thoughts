# Determinism Indistinguishable from Randomness
Let's inspect this random vs determined paradigm a bit.  Distinguishing between determined and random is very dependent on the amount of information we have. In fact, given a limited amount of information, determined events are indistinguishable from random ones. 

## PRINCIPLE: Determined Indistinguishable from Random
There exists a level of knowledge where a random event and a determined event are indistinguishable 

## The Pick the 100th Digit Game

To show this, let's play a game!  For this game, we have a long series of numbers from 0-9
> [!example]
> ```
> ...463328334071865904374453205724396837883902...
> ```

This list is constructed by a determined pattern; each new number added is determined by the previous numbers.

But I also make a list of numbers, generating each number randomly. 

Both of these lists can go on in either direction forever, so I keep generating numbers until I find a point where I can line up the list for 100 numbers, and they match.

If I show you the first 99 numbers, would the 100th number be randomly generated or determined? 

Either choice is correct; they are indistinguishable with this level of information.

## The Determine-Random Spectrum

This insight helps us see that when we evaluate whether an event is random or determined, we are really talking about a confidence interval, not certainty. So, while underlining each event is a binary truth, we only experience it as a spectrum.  Because we do not have all the information, we can only have a level of confidence if something is random or not.
