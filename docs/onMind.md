# On Mind

This essay is broken up into a few section, the first on On Schema is foundational to the others as it lays the framework on which I explore consousenes, free will, and ethics. 

## On Schema

A **schema** is best defined as a **trained abstract probabilistic simulator**.

It is a **simulator** in that it can generate multiple possible paths or outcomes not just a single prediction, but a dynamic engine capable of exploring different scenarios. It is **abstract** in that it strips away unnecessary details, retaining only the essential features needed for its purpose. It is **probabilistic** in that it uses heuristics to fill in the gaps, estimating likelihoods rather than certainties. And it is **trained** through experience and feedback, becoming more efficient at generating useful simulations over time.

Schemas dramatically reduce the brain's computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need to process all sensory inputs in detail. Instead of evaluating every piece of information, schemas allow the brain to quickly react based on simplified patterns and minimal inputs. They act as efficient mental shortcuts, letting us respond rapidly without having to analyze the full complexity of a situation.

### Examples of Core Schemas

Several core schemas are widely hypothesized in neuroscience and cognitive science. Each reflects this core definition. They are trained, abstract, probabilistic simulators built through development and refined by experience.

#### Body Schema

The **body schema** is a simulation of the body's shape, position, and capabilities. It allows us to move through the world without constantly needing to monitor our limbs visually.

- **Trained** through infancy and constantly refined through movement and sensory feedback  
- **Abstract** across different body positions, lighting conditions, or tool use  
- **Probabilistic** in its prediction of where the body should be

**Neuroscience example**: The *posterior parietal cortex* integrates visual, proprioceptive, and motor signals to maintain an up-to-date body schema. In people with damage to this area, phenomena like *asomatognosia* or *phantom limbs* reveal how the brain simulates the body even in the absence of direct input.

#### Attention Schema

The **attention schema** is a model of how attention is allocated, both one's own and others'. This schema allows us to anticipate what will be noticed or focused on.

- **Trained** through social and perceptual experience  
- **Abstract** across sensory modalities  
- **Probabilistic** in determining what is likely to be noticed

**Neuroscience example**: Michael Graziano's research suggests that the brain maintains an internal model of attention, which helps regulate conscious access and social prediction. This model allows us to not only track our focus, but infer what others might be focusing on as well.

#### Theory of Mind Schema

This schema simulates the mental states of others, including what they know, believe, want, or intend.

- **Trained** through interaction and communication  
- **Abstract** across individuals and situations  
- **Probabilistic** in its inferences about other minds

**Neuroscience example**: The *temporoparietal junction* and *medial prefrontal cortex* are involved in representing others' beliefs and intentions. Developmentally, children learn to construct this schema through play, storytelling, and conflict resolution.

### Schema Refinement Through Training: The Athlete Example

Schemas are not fixed. They are continuously trained and refined through exposure, feedback, and repetition. In training, we do not simply memorize actions. We reshape the underlying simulator.

Athletes are a clear example of this refinement:

- A gymnast or dancer develops a highly accurate **body schema** that allows for precise timing and balance  
- A quarterback or soccer player strengthens a **theory-of-mind schema** for predicting opponents' behaviors  
- In highly trained actions, **abstraction may actually decrease**. Movements become automatic and low-level simulation takes over for speed and efficiency

Training can **sharpen the predictive accuracy** of a schema and also **specialize it** for a narrow set of conditions. Both of these outcomes serve the same purpose: to make the brain's simulations faster, more accurate, and better matched to the task at hand.

### The Reality Schema: The Amalgamation of Schemas

While we describe these schemas body, attention, theory of mind, and othersâ€”as distinct entities, the boundaries between them are far from clear. When shaking someone's hand, for instance, it's impossible to cleanly separate where your body schema ends and your theory of mind schema begins. These categories are useful tools for analyzing brain function, but in reality, they are deeply interconnected facets of a single, comprehensive simulator: the **reality schema**.

The reality schema is the brain's unified simulation engine, where all these seemingly separate schemas blend and flow into one another. It is a continuously updated probabilistic model that is not just combine of these different aspects of experience, but an integration of them.

The reality schema is **not the world itself**. It is the internal simulation that **feels** like the world. It is how we navigate, interpret, and interact with our surroundings. It is our **personal reality**.


## On Consciousness
### The Nature and Unit of Consciousness
When we speak about consciousness, we are actually speaking about two related but distinct things. 

#### The Nature of Consciousness
The first is the nature of consciousness: the fact that experiences happen at all. We feel emotions, perceive the world around us, and have inner lives filled with thought, sensation, and awareness. This presence of experience, the sense that there is something it is like to exist, is the basic phenomenon we call consciousness.

#### The Unit of Consciousness
But alongside the nature of consciousness, there is another important aspect: the unit of consciousness. This is the sense that experience belongs to someone or something. It is not just that experiences occur; it is that I am having an experience. There is a bounded center, a unique perspective through which the world is encountered.

When we consider consciousness, we are always dealing with these two dimensions: the existence of experience itself, and the existence of a particular experiencer. To understand what consciousness truly is, and later to explore how it arises in us or how we might recreate it artificially, we need to keep both of these aspects in view.

### Consciousness is a Reality

I propose that consciousness is reality - specifically, it is what we experience. In humans, this manifests as the Reality Schema.

We can demonstrate this by examining situations where our individual Unit of Consciousness is challenged. Consider identical twins who are raised together and live similar lives. They often describe feeling as if they share a brain or struggle to feel distinct from each other. This makes sense if we view their Realities as their Consciousness. Their Reality Schemas began with identical "instruction sets" and have been trained on nearly identical experiences throughout their lives. As a result, their schemas are highly synchronized, leading their realities - their consciousness - to be deeply aligned.

This twin synchronization manifests in several scientifically documented ways:

1. **Genetic Synchronization**: Identical twins share 100% of their DNA, which means their neural architecture and basic processing systems are identical. This provides the foundation for their Reality Schemas to develop in parallel ways. Research shows that even their brain wave patterns during similar tasks are remarkably synchronized.

2. **Developmental Synchronization**: From birth, twins experience the world together, creating what developmental psychologists call "shared developmental trajectories." Their Reality Schemas are trained on nearly identical inputs, leading to similar neural pathways and processing patterns. This is why twins often develop similar interests, preferences, and even thought patterns.

3. **Emotional Synchronization**: Studies have shown that twins often experience emotional synchronization, where one twin's emotional state can directly influence the other's. This suggests their Reality Schemas are processing emotional information in similar ways, creating a form of shared emotional consciousness.

4. **Cognitive Synchronization**: Research in cognitive psychology has documented that twins often develop similar problem-solving strategies and decision-making processes. This indicates that their Reality Schemas are not just processing similar information but processing it in similar ways.

The key insight here is that twins' shared consciousness isn't just about similar experiences - it's about having nearly identical Reality Schemas that process those experiences in the same way. Their genetic identity provides the same "hardware," while their shared upbringing provides the same "training data," resulting in Reality Schemas that are so closely aligned that they can feel like a single consciousness split across two bodies.

We see a similar phenomenon, though more limited and compartmentalized, in teams that train intensively together. Navy SEAL teams and professional sports teams work deliberately to synchronize their realities. This enables them to function not as separate individuals but as a cohesive unit. Team members often describe this experience in ways that suggest a partial dissolution of their individual consciousness boundaries.

This team synchronization manifests in several measurable ways:

1. **Neural Synchronization**: Research shows that when team members perform coordinated tasks, their brain activity becomes synchronized. This is particularly evident in the alpha and beta frequency bands, which are associated with attention and motor coordination. This neural coupling suggests that their Reality Schemas are literally operating in sync.

2. **Shared Mental Models**: Teams develop what cognitive scientists call "shared mental models" - essentially synchronized Reality Schemas that allow them to predict each other's actions and intentions. This is why experienced teams can often communicate complex information with minimal explicit communication.

3. **Mirror Neuron Systems**: The mirror neuron system, which helps us understand and predict others' actions, becomes highly tuned in synchronized teams. This creates a form of "embodied simulation" where team members can literally feel what their teammates are experiencing.

4. **Flow States**: When teams achieve peak synchronization, they often enter what's called a "group flow state" - a shared experience of optimal performance where individual consciousness boundaries become more permeable. This is particularly evident in sports like basketball or soccer, where players describe feeling as if they can read each other's minds.

The key insight here is that these phenomena aren't just about behavioral coordination - they represent a genuine synchronization of Reality Schemas. When team members' schemas become aligned through intensive training and shared experience, their individual consciousness boundaries become more fluid, allowing for a form of shared consciousness that enables extraordinary levels of coordination and performance.

## On Free Will

What can this understanding of schemas tell us about the feeling of free will? This feeling that with some of our actions, we appear to be making a choice; not that the choice is random or thrust upon us.

### Exploring Non-Free Will

There are two categories of actions that don't feel like free will: actions without choice, and actions without will.

#### Actions Without Choice

There are many situations where we feel like we have no choice but to act in a certain way:

- When you touch something hot, you pull your hand away before you even consciously process it. This doesn't feel like a choice - it's an automatic response hardwired into our nervous system.

- When someone you love is in danger, you may act to protect them without any sense of choosing. The emotional drive is so strong that alternatives don't even enter consciousness.

- Sometimes social or moral imperatives feel so strong that we experience them as forces rather than choices. If you see someone drop their wallet, you might feel compelled to return it without experiencing this as a choice.

#### Actions Without Will

Similarly, there are times when our actions feel more random than chosen:

- When choosing between identical options (like which identical sock to put on first), we often act without any real decision-making process.

- After making many decisions, we sometimes reach a point where we stop weighing options and just pick something arbitrarily.

These examples highlight situations where our experience differs from the feeling of free will - either because we feel compelled by forces beyond our control or because our actions seem to lack conscious direction altogether.

### The Decision Schema

Like everything our brain does, we can expect that it uses a schema when evaluating why we have acted the way we do. As this decision simulator is abstracted, we do not have perfect information on why we took or will take an action. Instead, we are only left with a probabilistic distribution of reasons for our actions.

### Shape of the Distributions

The shape of this heuristic distribution is what gives rise to our feeling of free will.

#### The Single Choice

In a distribution where one possibility of action dominates all others, we do not feel like we had a choice - there was only one reasonable action. Let's examine our earlier examples through this lens of probability distributions:

- **Hot surface reaction**: The probability distribution here has an overwhelming spike for "pull hand away" with negligible probabilities for all other actions. Our brain's decision schema recognizes this as a "no choice" situation.

- **Protecting loved ones**: Similar to above, the distribution shows an extreme peak for "protect" with minimal probability mass elsewhere. The emotional and instinctual drivers create such a dominant option that alternatives barely register.

- **Returning a wallet**: Here the distribution might show a very high peak for "return it" due to moral/social conditioning, with small probabilities for "keep it" or "ignore it". While not as extreme as the reflexive examples, it's still lopsided enough that we experience it as compulsion rather than choice.

#### Too Many Equal Options

On the other extreme, if the distribution is flat with lots of options that have the same probability, we also do not feel free will - we instead feel a lack of will. Let's examine our earlier examples:

- **Identical socks**: The probability distribution here is perfectly flat across the options - each sock has exactly equal probability of being chosen. Our decision schema recognizes this uniform distribution as "random" rather than willed choice.

- **Decision fatigue**: When mentally exhausted, our probability distributions tend to flatten out across options. Rather than sharp peaks representing clear preferences, we see more uniform distributions that lead to experiences of random rather than willed choices.

#### The Shape of Free Will

But what if the distribution is not flat or spiked? What if there are multiple option that are reasonable but with vering degrees of probalbities? This is the shape of Free will

### The Power of Introspection

One power we have is the ability to introspect - to consciously examine our decisions and thought processes. When we direct our attention to a decision, we often change the amount of information feeding into our decision schema. Interestingly, this examination can significantly alter the shape of our probability distribution.

For example:
- Through introspection, we might realize we always put on the left sock first simply because we're right-handed and naturally reach to the left. This insight transforms what seemed like a random choice into a pattern driven by physical constraints.

- When we deeply examine the moral choice of returning a found wallet, we might consider alternative uses for the money or rationalize keeping a "finder's fee". This introspection can transform what initially felt like a clear moral imperative into a more complex decision with multiple weighted options - shifting from a spike-shaped distribution to one more characteristic of free will.
